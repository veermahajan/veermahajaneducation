# Veer Mahajan Education
## Who?
I'm Veer Mahajan, a 14 year old in California. I've loved math and STEM generally ever since I was a baby, and some of my hobbies today are learning new things, drawing, reading, and playing sports with my friends.
## Why?
I began my YouTube channel in fifth grade, where I made a variety of math videos. I realised, though, that videos aren't everything, and a lot of other resources are useful as well, such as questions (with solutions, of course), and articles. That's why I made this website - to share my passion and love for math in the best way I can!
## How?
I learnt coding on Khan Academy at first, but began to use a lot of other resources online to improve it. While I'm still nowhere near an expert, I'm still working hard to learn new ways to make better and better websites.
