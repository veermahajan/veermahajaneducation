		<li><details><summary>Alex and Jack have a total of 90 apples. Alex has 30 more than twice as many apples as Jack. How many apples does Jack have?</summary>We can begin by defining some variables.<br>Let \(a\) be the number of apples Alex have, and \(j\) how many Jack has. Then,<br>\(a + j = 90\)<br>\(a = 2j + 30\)<br>On solving the equation, we get \(j = 20\), so Jack has <span class="ans">20</span> apples.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Solve for \(x + y + z\) given \(13x + 18y - 2z = 232\) and \(2x + 3y - z = 5\).</summary>Notice that there are two equations but three variables; hence, it is impossible to solve for each variable individually and add it up. A different solution will be required.<br>Adding the two equations together yields \(15x + 21y - 3z = 237\), and dividing by 3 gives \(5x + 7y - z = 79\).<br>Now, we can perform \(5x + 7y - z - 2(2x + 3y - z) = 79 - 2(5)\). This gives us the final answer of \(x + y + z =\) <span class="ans">69</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">NYCIML - F06B08</span>] If \(x + y + z = 7\) and \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 10\), compute \(xy + xz + yz\).</summary>Notice that \((x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz)\). Hence, \(49 = 10 + 2(xy + xz + yz)\), and thus \(xy + xz + yz = \)<span class="ans"> 39/2</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">2007 AMC 10, Problem 9</span>] Real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy the equations \(3^a = 81^{b + 2}\) and \(125^b = 5^{a - 3}\). What is \(ab\)?</summary>Using properties of exponents, \(3^a = (3^4)^{b + 2}\) and \((5^3)^b = 5^{a-3}\). Hence, \(3^a = 3^{4b + 8}\) and \(5^{3b} = 5^{a-3}\), and so we get the system,<br>\(a = 4b + 8\)<br>\(3b = a - 3\)<br>This yields the solutions of \(a = -12\) and \(b = -5\), so \(ab =\) <span class="ans">60</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">1992 AIME, Problem 3</span>] A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly \(0.500\). During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than \(.503\). What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?</summary>We let the inital amount of games won be \(n\). Then, her initial win ratio is \(\frac{n}{2n} = 0.500\). If she wins three games and plays four in total, her new ratio is \(\frac{n+3}{2n+4}=0.503\). On solving, we find the largest value of \(n\) to be <span class="ans">164</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">1992 AIME, Problem 4</span>] In Pascal's Triangle, each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. The first few rows of the triangle are shown below.<img class="question" src="images/aime1992_p4_pic">In which row of Pascal's Triangle do three consecutive entries occur that are in the ratio \(3 :4 :5\)</summary>We let the inital amount of games won be \(n\). Then, her initial win ratio is \(\frac{n}{2n} = 0.500\). If she wins three games and plays four in total, her new ratio is \(\frac{n+3}{2n+4}=0.503\). On solving, we find the largest value of \(n\) to be <span class="ans">164</span>.</details></li>
