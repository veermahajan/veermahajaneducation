		<li><details><summary>Ravi has some bananas with him. He gives half of them to Viraj and two thirds of the remaining to Gaurav. He gives one third of this remainder to his mother. If he now has four bananas, how many does Gaurav have?</summary>We can begin by defining some variables.<br>Let \(b\) be the number of bananas Ravi has inititally. He gives \(\frac{b}{2}\) to Viraj, so he has \(\frac{b}{2}\) left. Since he gives two thirds of this to Gaurav, Gaurav gets \(\frac{b}{2}(\frac{2}{3}) = \frac{b}{3}\) bananas, leaving \(\frac{b}{3}\), of which he gives \(\frac{1}{3}\) to his mother, which is \(\frac{b}{3}(\frac{1}{3}) = \frac{b}{9}\). Hence, he has \(\frac{2b}{9} = 4\) bananas left, meaning there were initially 18 bananas (\(b = 18\)). Now, since Gaurav has \(\frac{b}{3}\) of these, he has \(18(\frac{1}{3}) =\) <span class="ans">6</span> bananas.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Alex and Jack have a total of 90 apples. Alex has 30 more than twice as many apples as Jack. How many apples does Jack have?</summary>We can begin by defining some variables.<br>Let \(a\) be the number of apples Alex have, and \(j\) how many Jack has. Then,<br>\(a + j = 90\)<br>\(a = 2j + 30\)<br>On solving the equation, we get \(j = 20\), so Jack has <span class="ans">20</span> apples.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>Solve for \(x + y + z\) given \(13x + 18y - 2z = 232\) and \(2x + 3y - z = 5\).</summary>Notice that there are two equations but three variables; hence, it is impossible to solve for each variable individually and add it up. A different solution will be required.<br>Adding the two equations together yields \(15x + 21y - 3z = 237\), and dividing by 3 gives \(5x + 7y - z = 79\).<br>Now, we can perform \(5x + 7y - z - 2(2x + 3y - z) = 79 - 2(5)\). This gives us the final answer of \(x + y + z =\) <span class="ans">69</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">NYCIML - F06B08</span>] If \(x + y + z = 7\) and \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 10\), compute \(xy + xz + yz\).</summary>Notice that \((x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + xz + yz)\). Hence, \(49 = 10 + 2(xy + xz + yz)\), and thus \(xy + xz + yz = \)<span class="ans"> 39/2</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">2007 AMC 10, Problem 9</span>] Real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy the equations \(3^a = 81^{b + 2}\) and \(125^b = 5^{a - 3}\). What is \(ab\)?</summary>Using properties of exponents, \(3^a = (3^4)^{b + 2}\) and \((5^3)^b = 5^{a-3}\). Hence, \(3^a = 3^{4b + 8}\) and \(5^{3b} = 5^{a-3}\), and so we get the system,<br>\(a = 4b + 8\)<br>\(3b = a - 3\)<br>This yields the solutions of \(a = -12\) and \(b = -5\), so \(ab =\) <span class="ans">60</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">1992 AIME, Problem 3</span>] A tennis player computes her win ratio by dividing the number of matches she has won by the total number of matches she has played. At the start of a weekend, her win ratio is exactly \(0.500\). During the weekend, she plays four matches, winning three and losing one. At the end of the weekend, her win ratio is greater than \(.503\). What's the largest number of matches she could've won before the weekend began?</summary>We let the inital amount of games won be \(n\). Then, her initial win ratio is \(\frac{n}{2n} = 0.500\). If she wins three games and plays four in total, her new ratio is \(\frac{n+3}{2n+4}=0.503\). On solving, we find the largest value of \(n\) to be <span class="ans">164</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: Edited from <span class="source">1992 AIME, Problem 4</span>] In <a target="_blank" href="images/aime1992_p4_pic"></a>Pascal's Triangle</a>, each entry is the sum of the two entries above it. In which row of Pascal's Triangle do three consecutive entries occur that are in the ratio \(3 :4 :5\)?</summary>Because of the given ratio, we can relate the three entries through \(\frac{\binom{n}{k-1}}{3}:\frac{\binom{n}{k}}{4}:\frac{\binom{n}{k+1}}{5}\), where \(n\) is the row and \(k-1\), \(k\), and \(k+1\) are three entries within it. Using the first two terms, we find \(\frac{n!}{3(k-1)!(n-k+1)!}=\frac{n!}{4k!(n-k)!}\). <br>On canceling the numerators and \((n-k)!\) and \((k-1)!\) from the denominators, we see \(\frac{1}{3(n-k+1)} = \frac{1}{4k}\), which means \(k=\frac{3(n+1)}{7}\). <br>Very similarly, using the second two terms, we find \(k = \frac{4n-5}{9}\). Remembering \(k=\frac{3(n+1)}{7}\), we can find \(n\), which is the row number, to be <span class="ans">62</span>.</details></li>
		<li><details><summary>[Source: <span class="source">1986 Putnam, Problem B1</span>] Inscribe a rectangle of base \(b\) and height \(h\) in a circle of radius one, and inscribe an isosceles triangle in the region of the circle cut off by one base of the rectangle (with that side as the base of the triangle). For what value of \(h\) do the rectangle and triangle have the same area?</summary>Since the radius is 1, the height of the triangle will be \(1 - \frac{h}{2}\), and its base will be \(b\). Hence, its area is \(frac{b(1-\frac{h}{2})}{2}\), while the rectangle's is simply \(bh\). On equating the two, we find \(2h = 1 - \frac{h}{2}\), so \(5h = 2\) and <span class="ans">h = 2/5</span>.</details></li>
